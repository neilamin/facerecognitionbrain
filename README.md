## Synopsis

This project was created as my final project for Udemy's "The Complete Web Developer in 2018: Zero to Mastery". This Web App serves as Facial Recognition App that can identify a face from any picture added to it. The app was written with React, Node, and Express with a PostgreSQL Database.

The smart-brain directory contains the front-end of the application and smart-brain-api contains the back-end.
